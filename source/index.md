I receive my bachelor’s degree with honered rank(top 5% students) in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at University of Science and Technology of China in 2017.

In my spare time, I love playing basketball and I am a big fan of [KING JAMES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James)(that is why I choose “James” as my English name). Music is also my favorite. I like listening to all kinds of music and can play a little guitar, ukelele and piano.
