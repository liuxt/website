title: About me
---
I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I am a member of Advanced Networking and System Research Laboratory ([ANSRLab](http://ansrlab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/)) and my supervisor is [Prof. John C.S. Lui](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/). I receive my bachelor’s degree with honered rank(top 5% students) in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at University of Science and Technology of China in 2017.

My major interests are machine learning theory as well as stochastic modeling. Among them, multi-armed bandit and provable efficient reinforcement learning are my recent research focus. In addiction, I am interested in network science, including research in social networks.

My CV is [here](http://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~liuxt/Resume.pdf)/这里.

In my spare time, I love playing basketball and I am a big fan of [KING JAMES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James) (that is why I choose “James” as my English name). Music is also my favorite. I like listening to all kinds of music and can play a little guitar, ukelele and piano. I also enjoy playing Multi-player Online Battle Arena (MOBA), e.g., Honor of Kings.
